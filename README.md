<!--Hello!
I'm Milla Hein√§nen, a student at LAB University of Applied Sciences. I'm studying for a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information and Communications Technology, and I created this profile for my studies.

I have studied Information Technology in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in 2024, and have used GitHub to create my own responsive website with Visual Studio Code using CSS and HTML.

I'm Milla Hein√§nen, a Bachelor of Engineering student in Information and Communications Technology at *LAB University of Applied Sciences*.

Previously, I studied Information Technology at *Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences* **(2024)**, where I began building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and Visual Studio Code with GitHub for version control.

I'm very interested in web development, version control, and learning new technologies. This GitHub profile showcases my academic projects and personal experiments.
